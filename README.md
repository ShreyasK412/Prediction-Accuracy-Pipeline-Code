# Prediction-Accuracy-Pipeline-Code

This repository contains code that accompaines the paper **Insert Paper Name Here**. The repository is divided into 3 different parts **Data Construction**, **LSTMCode**, and **PredictabilityMetricCode**

Each folder contains the neccesary data, code, and run instructions for the respective part of the speech predictability pipeline.

# Getting Started
You will need a platform that can run Interactive Python Notebook file formats(.ipynb file extensions). Becuase of the large amount of data and computations used and the neccesity to easily share results quickly our lab used [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.google/)
